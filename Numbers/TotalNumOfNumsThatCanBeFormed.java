/**
	Question: Given 4 digits. Find the sum of all the 4-digit numbers that can be formed using these 4 digits such that no number is repeated.

	Example: Suppose say we have the following digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and we need to form 4 digit numbers.
		==>	All four digits numbers would be 5*4*3*2 = 120
		 	Let us begin with the units digit to start totaling them all.
			120 means every number comes 120/5 = 24 times so that ( 1+2+3+4+5 )*24 = 360, the same happens with tens, hundreds, thousands so that we can 360 as common and just do simple maths that is 
			360(1000+100+10+1)=360*1111=399960
