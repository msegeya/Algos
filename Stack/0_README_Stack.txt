Introduction to Stack

Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stack
Infix2Postfix.java

Evaluation of Postfix Expression
EvalutePostfix.java

Reverse a String using Stack
-- push into the stack and pop each element and print.

Implement two stacks in an array
--  Use single array for two stacks. One end should be for one stack and the other for another stack.
	If we reach mid point then the corresponding stack is full.

Check for balanced parentheses in an expression
BalanceParenthesis.java

Does duplicate parenthesis exists in an expression or not.
DuplicateParenthesis.java

Next Greater Element
NextGreatestEle.java

Reverse a stack using recursion
ReverseStack.java

Sort a stack using recursion
SortStack.java

The Stock Span Problem
StockSpanPro.java

Design and Implement Special Stack Data Structure
StackMin.java

Implement Stack using Queues
StackUsingQueue.java

Design a stack with operations on middle element
StackMiddleElement.java

How to create mergable stack?
StacksUsingLL.java

How to efficiently implement k stacks in a single array?
K_Stacks.java

Iterative Tower of Hanoi
Check http://geeksquiz.com/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/
This should be good.

Length of the longest valid substring
Look at BalanceParenthesis.java and get the lengtof the string until where we have a valid parenthesis.

Find maximum of minimum for every window size in a given array
Very Complex. We will ignore it .. :P

Check if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search Tree
PreOrderTravValidation.java

Minimum number of bracket reversals needed to make an expression balanced
Okay Okay problem. Remove all the braces that are actually matching and then check whether the flip-flops can lead to a balacing or not. If leading then count the number of flip-flops and return the count.

Iterative Depth First Traversal of Graph
Graphs/Graphs_1/DFS.java

Print ancestors of a given binary tree node without recursion
Trees/BT/NodeAncestors.java

Expression Evaluation
1) Convert this to Postfix notation using Infix2Postfix.java
2) Solve the postfix notation using EvaluatePostfix.java

Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram | Set 2

Iterative Postorder Traversal (Using Two Stack)
