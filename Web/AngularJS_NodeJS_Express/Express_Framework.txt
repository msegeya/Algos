- Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. 

- EXPRESS.JS FRAMEWORK BASICS
	*) Server-side web and mobile application framework
	*) Language: written in JavaScript
	*) Express builds:
			Single-page, multi-page, and hybrid mobile and web apps
			Common back-end functions for web applications
			APIs (application programming interfaces)
	*) Templating engines: Express comes with two templating engines, Jade and EJS, which facilitate the flow of data into a website structure.
	*) MVC pattern: Express supports the Model-View-Controller architecture, a really helpful way to build websites in a model-driven format.
	*) Platform: Node.js
	*) Operating system: It’s cross-platform, so it’s not limited to one OS.
	*) The Express Generator lets you create complex applications quickly.

- Node.js alone cannot do the required stuff so we need a whole framework which can hold both the front end and the back end.
