Linked List Questions:

- Nth Node fromt end of LL
	NthNodeLast.java

- Stack using Linked List
	StackLL.java

- LL has cycle or not in O(n)
	SLLCycle.java

- In a LL cycle find the start node
	SLLCycleStartNode.java

- Floyd cycle algorithm
	SLLCycleStartNode.java

- Sort a linked list
	SortSLL.java

- Insert node in sorted LL
	Simple insert. Refer http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-linked-list-which-is-sorted-how-will-you-insert-in-sorted-way/

- Reverse SLL with and without Recursion
	ReverseSLL.java

- Middle of LL
	MidPointSLL.java

- LL even or odd
	EvenOddSLL.java

- Segregate even and odd position nodes into two lists (evenList and oddList)
	SegregateEvenOddLL.java

- Find Intersection point of two LL
	IntersectionNodeSLL.java

- Split circular LL in to two equal parts
	SplitCircularLL.java
	
- Circular LL - (Check Queue directory.)
	

- LL is palindrome or not
	PalindromeLL.java

- Exchange adjacents elements in a LL
	See ReverseKNodes.java for generic k implementation.	

- Reverse blocks (2, 3, 4, ..) of nodes in a LL. Ex: Convert 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> X 	to 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> X
	ReverseKNodes.java

- Head ptr pointing to Kth element. How to get the elements before Kth element.
	Head is the first node of a SLL. You cannot get the elements before K unless it is a doubly linked list (DLL).
	But if you say SLL then once you go to Kth node then there is no way to come back to previous nodes.

- LL contains data ptr, random pointer. Clone it
	CloneRandomLL.java

- BT to DLL
Refer Trees chapter.
